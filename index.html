        <p class="question">Favorite CMSC subject so far</p>
        <p class="answer">CMSC 12 because it was my first coding subject in UP. It ended up being a fun experience for me and it was when I was assured that I am indeed the right degree program.</p>

        <p class="question">Favorite GE so far</p>
        <p class="answer">STS 1 because coming from a science high school, I really didn't know why I was studying science but STS 1 was able to show me the reason why we study science.</p>

        <p class="question">Favorite PL</p>
        <p class="answer">Python because overall, I find it very easy to use while still being a powerful programming language.</p>

        <p class="question">Favorite Food</p>
        <p class="answer">Ice cream because it's a great dessert for any events be it as a comfort food or as a reward after an achievement. My favorite flavors are cookies and cream & double dutch!</p>
